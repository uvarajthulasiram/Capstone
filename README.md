# Sentiment-Based Product Recommendation System

URL to Access: https://capstone-4qn4.onrender.com

I have created this project as part of AI/ML course by IIIT-Bangalore and Upgrad. This is a **Python-based product recommendation system** that combines **sentiment analysis** and **collaborative filtering** to suggest products to users and find similar items. It leverages **XGBoost**, **TF-IDF**, and **user-item similarity matrices** for accurate recommendations.

  - Preprocessing includes tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
  - Uses a fully optimized **XGBoost pipeline** with TF-IDF feature extraction.

- **User-User Recommendation**
  - Suggests products to users based on similar user preferences.

- **Item-Item Recommendation**
  - Finds similar items based on ratings from users who liked the product.
